        about: `Motivated with ever-lasting curiosity, 
        I always wanted to work in a team with cutting age technologies. 
        Being a lawyer for 7 years I realized that bare application of quite stable 
        knowledge doesn’t develop me as much as I would like too. In the IT world changes 
        are happening everyday and this is my style to follow them and keep this fast pace 
        in acquiring new skills. That is why I was so excited to start my career change. 
        Every day I find out new technologies that I cannot wait to use on practice`,
